🌟 Welcome to my little corner of GitHub! I'm Youwei Huang, your friendly neighborhood research engineer and team manager at the Institute of Intelligent Computing Technology in Suzhou, CAS. My playground? Just some tinkering with <b>Large Language Models (LLM)</b>, <b>Blockchain</b>, and <b>Software Engineering</b>.
<br><br>
🛠️ When I’m not pretending to be a mad scientist, I’m leading projects that blend academic research with real-world applications. A few patents here, some papers there – casually shaping the future.
<br><br>
🔬 I dabble in research, engineering, and business. Be it blockchain, web3, or generative AI – I’m here to push the envelope.
<br><br>
💼 Currently, I’m leading some cool open-source projects like [UniAI](https://github.com/orgs/uniai-lab/repositories), [LeChat](https://lechat.cas-ll.cn), and [SmartIntentNN](https://github.com/web3se-lab/web3-sekit). They involve LLM, deep learning, software engineering, web development, and blockchain.
<br><br>
🚀 My mission? To sprinkle scientific research magic into our daily grind and make a dent in the industrial universe. Dream big, right?
<br><br>
🤝 If you’re as psyched about these fields as I am or have some killer ideas, join the fun! I’m always open to collaborations. Let's make some cool stuff together!
