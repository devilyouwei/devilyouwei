🌟 Welcome to my GitHub corner! I'm Youwei Huang, a research engineer and team lead at the Institute of Intelligent Computing Technology in Suzhou, CAS.

 I work on **Large Language Models (LLM)**, **Blockchain**, and **Software Engineering**.

💼 Currently, I'm leading some exciting open-source projects like [UniAI](https://github.com/orgs/uniai-lab/repositories), [LeChat](https://lechat.cas-ll.cn), and [SmartIntentNN](https://github.com/web3se-lab/web3-sekit). They cover LLM, deep learning, software engineering, web development, and blockchain.

🛠️ When I'm not deep in research, I lead projects that combine academic insights with real-world applications. I have a few patents and papers, aiming to push technological boundaries.

🔬 My interests include research, engineering, and business. Whether it's blockchain, Web3, or generative AI, I'm exploring new frontiers.

🤝 If you're passionate about these fields or have amazing ideas, let's collaborate! I'm always open to new and exciting projects. Let's create something awesome together!
