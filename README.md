🌟 Welcome to my little corner of GitHub! I'm Youwei Huang, a research engineer and team manager at the Institute of Intelligent Computing Technology in Suzhou, CAS.
<br><br>
👷 Just some tinkering with <b>Large Language Models (LLM)</b>, <b>Blockchain</b>, and <b>Software Engineering</b>.
<br><br>
🛠️ When I’m not pretending to be a mad scientist, I’m leading projects that blend academic research with real-world applications. A few patents here, some papers there – casually shaping the future.
<br><br>
🔬 I dabble in research, engineering, and business. Be it blockchain, web3, or generative AI – I’m here to push the envelope.
<br><br>
💼 Currently, I’m leading some cool open-source projects like [UniAI](https://github.com/orgs/uniai-lab/repositories), [LeChat](https://lechat.cas-ll.cn), and [SmartIntentNN](https://github.com/web3se-lab/web3-sekit). They involve LLM, deep learning, software engineering, web development, and blockchain.
<br><br>
🚀 My mission? To sprinkle scientific research magic into our daily grind and make a dent in the industrial universe. Dream big, right?
<br><br>
🤝 If you’re as psyched about these fields as I am or have some killer ideas, join the fun! I’m always open to collaborations. Let's make some cool stuff together!
