**AI for SE Research - Web3 Software Engineering**  
_Jan 2022 ‚Äì Present_  
_Macau University of Science and Technology_  

Traditional software engineering (SE) models, methods, and tools are increasingly inadequate for developing blockchain-based Web3 applications. Our research focuses on AI for Web3 SE, applying deep learning techniques to address challenges in Web3 development. We have just started our research on Web3 SE, currently focusing on the detection, repair, and generation of smart contracts.

- **SmartIntentNN:** A deep learning model for detecting unsafe development intents in smart contracts
- **SmartBERT:** A pre-trained programming language model for learning representations of smart contracts
