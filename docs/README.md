## Research & Projects

**AI for SE Research - Software Engineering for Web3**

_Jan 2022 ‚Äì Present_  
_Macau University of Science and Technology_  
_Supervisor: Associate Professor Tao Zhang_

The current software engineering models, methods, and tools are no longer suitable for developing Web3 applications on the blockchain. My research focuses on exploring the integration of blockchain technology with deep neural network (DNN) models to address challenges in Web3 development. Key contributions include:

-   **SmartIntentNN**: Published two papers on a novel approach to detecting malicious intents in smart contracts.
-   **SmartBERT**: Trained a large language model specifically for smart contract representation, following the paradigms of BERT and RoBERTa to learn spatial representations through pre-training. SmartBERT supports downstream tasks related to smart contracts in software engineering.

**BigData Project - Precise Epidemic Control**

_May 2020 ‚Äì May 2021_  
_Institute of Intelligent Computing Technology, Suzhou, CAS_  
_Supervisor: Professor Peiheng Zhang_

This project leverages Bluetooth, WiFi, and other wireless signals to analyze regional pandemic situations and anonymously trace social contact networks. We developed data models to quantify regional safety and human health metrics, and visualized real-time analysis results to assist medical workers in epidemic prevention efforts. Our key contributions include:

1. Supporting government efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic.
2. Publishing the paper "Precise Epidemic Control based on GeoHash".
3. Obtaining three authorized national patents (first author).

**Blockchain Project - Application of Blockchain in Medical Health**

_May 2021 - Oct 2022_  
_Institute of Intelligent Computing Technology, Suzhou, CAS_  
_Supervisor: Professor Xiaofang Zhao_

As the primary lead of the "Le-chain Commercial Medical Insurance Service Consortium Blockchain System and Application" project, I significantly advanced blockchain technology in healthcare. This platform integrates patients, hospitals, insurance companies, and government health committees, enhancing data exchange security, reimbursement efficiency, and patient privacy. Our project, which showcased advantages in pancreatic cancer treatment collaboration, received the "2022 Jiangsu Province Blockchain Industry Development Pilot Demonstration Project" award. My contributions include authoring several technical white papers and holding multiple invention patents, such as "AI-based Smart Contract Intent Detection" and "NFT-based E-Certificates Issuance and Verification."
