## Research & Projects

**LLM Project - LeChat: The Next Generation Content Platform Based on Hybrid Models and knowledge Graphs**

_May 2020 ‚Äì May 2021_  
_Institute of Intelligent Computing Technology, Suzhou, CAS_

LeChat is a content analysis and generation platform built on large language models and knowledge graphs. Compared to traditional content platforms, LeChat leverages cutting-edge generative AI technology to enhance user efficiency in information acquisition and content creation. LeChat can read and analyze Office files and image files. Moreover, it can generate text, images, charts, and document content based on user prompts. To address the limitations of knowledge scope and the divergent nature of large language models, LeChat utilizes knowledge graph RAG techniques to enhance model capabilities and expand its cognitive domain.

-   The background technique, UniAI, has yielded a comprehensive Gen-AI solution based on knowledge graphs and hybrid LLMs.
-   Two commercial projects utilizing this technology have already been successfully implemented.
