## Research & Projects

**LLM Project - LeChat: The Next Generation Content Platform Based on Hybrid Models and Knowledge Graphs**

_Mar 2023 ‚Äì Now_  
_Institute of Intelligent Computing Technology, Suzhou, CAS_

LeChat is a content analysis and generation platform built on large language models and knowledge graphs. Compared to traditional content platforms, LeChat leverages cutting-edge generative AI technology to enhance user efficiency in information acquisition and content creation. LeChat can parse and analyze Office files, image files and text messages. Moreover, it can generate text, images, charts, and document content based on user prompts. To address the limitations of knowledge scope and the divergent nature of large language models, LeChat utilizes knowledge graph RAG techniques to enhance model capabilities and expand its cognitive domain.

-   The background technique, UniAI, has yielded a comprehensive Gen-AI solution based on knowledge graphs and hybrid LLMs.
-   Two commercial projects utilizing this technology have already been successfully implemented.

**AI for SE Research - Software Engineering of Web3**

_Jan 2022 ‚Äì Present_  
_Macau University of Science and Technology_  
_Supervisor: Associate Professor Tao Zhang_

The current software engineering models, methods, and tools are no longer suitable for developing Web3 applications on the blockchain. My research focuses on exploring the integration of blockchain technology with deep neural network (DNN) models to address challenges in Web3 development. Key contributions include:

-   **SmartIntentNN**: Published two papers on a novel approach to detecting malicious intents in smart contracts
-   **SmartBERT**: Trained a large language model specifically for smart contract representation, following the paradigms of BERT and RoBERTa to learn spatial representations through pre-training. SmartBERT supports downstream tasks related to smart contracts in software engineering

_May 2020 ‚Äì May 2021_  
_Institute of Intelligent Computing Technology, Suzhou, CAS_  
_Supervisor: Professor Peiheng Zhang_

This project leverages Bluetooth, WiFi, and other wireless signals to analyze regional pandemic situations and anonymously trace social contact networks. We developed data models to quantify regional safety and human health metrics, and visualized real-time analysis results to assist medical workers in epidemic prevention efforts. Our key contributions include:

-   Supported government efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic
-   Published the paper "Precise Epidemic Control based on GeoHash" on DSA2022
-   Obtained 4 patents (3 authorized)
-   Selected for the "2021 Suzhou Science and Technology Association Young Science and Technology Talent Support Project"

**Blockchain Project - Application of Blockchain in Medical Health**

_May 2021 - Oct 2023_  
_Institute of Intelligent Computing Technology, Suzhou, CAS_  
_Supervisor: Professor Xiaofang Zhao_

As project manger of the "Le-chain Commercial Medical Insurance Service Consortium Blockchain System and Application", I significantly advanced blockchain technology in healthcare. This project created a secure and trustworthy medical data exchange platform, integrating patients, hospitals, commercial insurance companies, and government health committees through a consortium blockchain network (Le-chain). It significantly enhanced medical insurance reimbursement efficiency, resolved data trust issues among various medical entities, prevented data tampering, and protected patient privacy with blockchain encryption algorithms, allowing data access only to authorized institutions.

-   Won the "2022 Jiangsu Province Blockchain Industry Development Pilot Demonstration Project" award
-   Authored several blockchain technical white papers
-   Completed 5 invention patents
-   Incubated a blockchain team and company: <https://www.cas-ll.com/team>
